# Boa
Boa is the simple, fast and reliable PHP Framework. It's a lightweight PHP Library that's focused on being easy to learn and use, safe and secure, and incredibly reliable.
Boa is only 27kB in size, making it one of the smallest PHP Libraries in existence.

## What is Boa for?
Boa is designed to make your everyday PHP tasks faster, more secure, and more standardized.
For example, if your PHP application had multiple calls to a database, and you discovered a vulnerability, you'd have to patch them all - and risk missing one out.
But with Boa, we patch it once and your application receives the same patch everywhere.
Your code is standardized and the same across the board, you don't have to waste time setting up the basics, and you don't have to worry about security or speed.

## System Requirements
- PHP 8.0 or higher.

## Projects that use Boa
- Pixelset (LMWNWeb/Pixelset)
- WhatAccomm? (whataccomm.com)
